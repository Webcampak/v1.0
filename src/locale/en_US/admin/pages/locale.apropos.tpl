<h5>About Webcampak</h5>
<p>
Webcampak is a image hub, it is dedicated to image capture over long periods. Initially, Webcampak has been created to work with digital cameras (DSLR), but internal software is able to work with various capture sources such as: <br />
- Digital cameras (PTP mode) <br />
- USB Webcams<br />
- IP Cameras <br />
- Web pictures (HTTP / FTP) <br />
- Streaming (RTSP) <br /><br />
Pictures captured are then processed and stored either on the internal hard drive, an external network device or on the internet.
