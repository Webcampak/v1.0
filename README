Introduction:
=============
This software has been created to assist people in capturing pictures over a long period of time by creating an "appliance" with a set of pre-configured softwares and scripts.
More details are available on sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcampak/
A full documentation is available at:
 - Francais: http://doc.webcampak.com/fr/
 - English: http://doc.webcampak.com/en/
To get a pre-configured and ready to use system visit http://www.webcampak.com

If you want to participate in the project please get in touch via sourceforge or webcampak.com

Installation of the software should provide you with an operational photography appliance. 
It has been created to be installed on a dedicated device (although you should be able to run it on your everyday latop running Ubuntu desktop).
By device it could be almost anything running Ubuntu Server (PC, laptop, PS3, nettop, embedded computer, ...).
